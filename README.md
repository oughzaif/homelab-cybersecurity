 🖥️ Virtual Machines Used

| Operating System     | Role                  | Tools Installed                                        |
|----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Kali Linux**       | Attacker              | Bettercap, Nmap, Wireshark, (planned: Metasploit)     |
| **Kali Purple**      | Defensive / Monitoring| Suricata, Zeek, Wazuh, CyberChef                       |
| **Windows 7 Ultimate** | Victim / Target     | Testing payloads, sniffing, spoofing, network analysis |

 🧰 Tools & Techniques Practiced

- ✅ ARP spoofing with **Bettercap**
- ✅ MAC flooding using `macof`
- ✅ Real-time packet sniffing with `net.sniff`
- ✅ Network visibility mapping using `net.show`
- ✅ Network obfuscation with flooding to hide attacks
- 🔜 Coming soon: `msfvenom` payload creation and reverse shell exploitation
